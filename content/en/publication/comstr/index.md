abstract: The purpose is to understand the main elements and operating principles of computer systems, such as processors and memories, and to understand the interaction between software that goes through the operation process. Understand the main components of a computer system, performance, and basic calculations and logic structures that drive a computer, and instruction operations using them. Based on the first half, analyze the operation of the computational processor and memory in the computer, or understand the parallel operation in processor or cluster computing.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
