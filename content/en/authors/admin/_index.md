    summary: |
      Computer engineering is a field that researches software and artificial intelligence technology that operates on various devices including computer, computer hardware design, and data processing based on the theoretical basis of information and calculation. It is a key field necessary for current and future industries to lead the AI era and realize the future intelligent information society, hyper-connected society, and the 4th industrial revolution. Computer engineering is a universal meta field that can innovate on the basis of data and software in all industries, including traditional manufacturing, beyond software and Internet industries, so digital talents who majored in computer engineering are needed in society as a whole. The Department of Computer and Artificial Intelligence has derived nine major competencies, 5C-GIANT (major core competency, coding competency, self-directed competency, convergence competency, communication competency, global competency, field working competency, AI competency, and new technology competency), and has been reorganizing the education system to foster globally competitive human resources beyond Korea while equipping these competencies. Currently, our computer artificial intelligence department consists of 24 globally competitive faculty members, and we are currently operating AI, IoT, cloud/big data, blockchain/information protection in-depth major (track) reflecting new technologies. In addition, in graduate course, we are conducting leading research in artificial intelligence (natural language processing, computer vision), data science, information retrieval, computer graphics, information protection/cryptography, human-to-computer interaction, computer network, database, mobile computing, and software engineering, and we are continuously strengthening our infrastructure and research capabilities to cultivate high-quality professional manpower necessary for the overall computer engineering.

#    summary: |
#      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.
